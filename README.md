# Hands-on 01

Using some database from the Internet, create a Colab notebook using Python language and the NetworkX library. Import your database and explore some complex network metrics. 

Print the graph summarization and the degree distribution. Draw the graph using different types of layouts. In the end, discuss the final result highlighting the network features.
